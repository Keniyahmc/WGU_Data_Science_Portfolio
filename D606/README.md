# D606 â€“ Data Science Capstone

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview  
This capstone course integrated the full data science lifecycle to solve a real-world business problem using machine learning. Students selected a research question, prepared and analyzed data, trained and evaluated models, and communicated insights through technical documentation and a final presentation. The project emphasized predictive modeling, data storytelling, and applying technical skills to support decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Competencies Demonstrated
- Defined and justified a business-aligned research question
- Cleaned and prepared data for modeling (outlier removal, encoding, normalization)
- Trained a Random Forest regression model to predict used car prices
- Evaluated model performance using RÂ² and MAE
- Communicated results through a data storytelling presentation

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDF report and PowerPoint-style storytelling
- Git for version control

## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks

### Task 1 & 2: Data Analysis and Model Development
- Explored and profiled 4,009 rows of used car listings.
- Cleaned mileage, removed pricing outliers, and encoded categorical variables.
- Split data 60/40 and trained a **Random Forest Regressor**.
- Achieved ~70% accuracy (RÂ² = 0.6990), MAE â‰ˆ $8,025.
- Identified top predictors: brand, mileage, year, and fuel type.
