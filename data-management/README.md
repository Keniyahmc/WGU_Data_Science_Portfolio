# D597 â€“ Data Management

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
This course builds proficiency in both **relational** and **non-relational** database systems. Key topics include data architecture selection, normalization vs. denormalization, data types and structures, and querying techniques. Students apply both **SQL (DDL & DML)** and NoSQL concepts to construct logical and physical data models that support business objectives.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Competencies Demonstrated
- Recommending an appropriate data architecture
- Examining data quality, structure, and relationships
- Designing logical and physical data models
- Performing SQL queries to answer business questions
- Using DDL and DML statements to manage data
- Differentiating between relational and non-relational approaches

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL / pgAdmin
- MongoDB (NoSQL)
- SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations)
- JSON Data Structures
- Python (optional for integration or analysis)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Task1_Relational_DB_Design/` | Designed and implemented a normalized relational database using PostgreSQL. Tasks included schema design, indexing, and running optimized queries. |
| `Task2_NonRelational_DB_Modeling/` | Designed a non-relational database using MongoDB, transforming structured data into a JSON-based document model. Tasks included modeling, importing, querying, and comparing to relational output. |

---

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- Built normalized schemas and implemented indexing strategies for optimized querying
- Applied real-world business queries using SQL (joins, filters, aggregations)
- Explored flexibility of NoSQL for hierarchical and semi-structured data
- Practiced converting relational models into non-relational equivalents based on use case
- Strengthened understanding of database design trade-offs in scalability, consistency, and complexity
