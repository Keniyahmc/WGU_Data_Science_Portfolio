# D598 â€“ Analytics Programming

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
This course develops algorithmic thinking and hands-on programming skills using both **Python** and **R**. Students learn how to acquire, organize, and manipulate datasets using standard libraries and packages. The course also introduces basic statistical analysis and data visualization through graphical interfaces and scripting. No prior programming experience is required.

## ðŸŽ¯ Competencies Demonstrated
- Documented the components of complex programming tasks
- Integrated syntax, control structures, and modular code
- Performed data acquisition and organization using Python 

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks

### Task 1: Program Planning
Created a **flowchart** and **pseudocode** for a Python program that analyzes business financial data. The logic includes loading data, identifying duplicates, performing group-based statistical analysis, filtering based on debt-to-equity ratios, and merging results.

### Task 2: Python & R Programming
Implemented a Python script (in Jupyter Notebook) that follows the pseudocode created in Task 1. The code uses pandas and matplotlib to perform statistical analysis and visualizations of company revenue, debt, and financial ratios.

### Task 3: Presentation & Documentation
Explained the code implementation step-by-step, including how it matched the pseudocode and logic designed earlier. Also included and described four custom visualizations:
1. **Bar chart** of average profit margin by state
2. **Line graph** of revenue vs liabilities
3. **Pie chart** of debt-to-equity ratio categories
4. **Histogram** of debt-to-income ratio distribution
