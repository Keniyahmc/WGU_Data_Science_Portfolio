# D600 – Statistical Data Mining

## 📘 Course Overview
This course focused on **supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques**, including linear and logistic regression, and dimensionality reduction through **principal component analysis (PCA)**. Emphasis was placed on applying statistical models to support business decision-making, understanding relationships among variables, and simplifying data to uncover meaningful insights.

## 📂 Project Tasks

### Task 1: Multiple Linear Regression
- Explored a dataset of home listings to predict housing prices.
- Built a multivariate regression model to evaluate the impact of variables such as square footage and number of bedrooms.
- Interpreted coefficients and R² value to assess model quality.

### Task 2: Logistic Regression
- Classified properties as “luxury” or “non-luxury” based on price, size, and other variables.
- Created a logistic regression model and interpreted odds ratios and classification accuracy.
- Evaluated model effectiveness using confusion matrix and ROC curve.
