# D605 â€“ Optimization

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
This course explored algorithmic approaches to solving optimization problems across various business scenarios. Students learned to identify objective functions and constraints, classify problems (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, bounded vs. unbounded), and apply tools such as Python and R to solve them. Emphasis was placed on business decision-making, cost reduction, and improving efficiency through mathematical modeling.
