# D599 â€“ Data Preparation and Exploration

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
This course focused on the early stages of the **data analytics lifecycle**, including data cleaning, wrangling, profiling, statistical interpretation, and visualization. Students practiced preparing datasets for analysis, interpreting both descriptive and inferential statistics, and applying hypothesis testing methods. Emphasis was also placed on effectively communicating insights using visualizations and business-oriented recommendations.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks

### Task 1: Data Cleaning and Profiling
- Profiled a dataset containing employee data across 16 variables.
- Identified and resolved quality issues, including duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers.
- Cleaned and standardized categorical variables and corrected invalid numeric entries.

### Task 2: Data Exploration & Hypothesis Testing
- Conducted univariate and bivariate statistical analysis.
- Visualized trends across variables like BMI, Age, Smoking status, and Charges.
- Performed both **t-tests** and **Mann-Whitney U tests** to evaluate relationships between variables.
- Concluded that smoking status significantly impacts medical charges.
