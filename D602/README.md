# D602 â€“ Deployment

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
This course focused on **operationalizing machine learning models** within a business context. Key topics included analyzing business requirements, building scalable and secure pipelines, deploying predictive models, and implementing APIs to integrate insights into broader systems. The course emphasized real-world implementation strategies using MLOps principles.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks

### Task 1: Business Case Analysis
- Evaluated **Kronkersâ€™ need for MLOps** to consolidate efforts across departments.
- Outlined **technical and organizational challenges** such as tool compatibility, team skill gaps, and limited budget.
- Recommended a centralized, version-controlled, secure, and scalable MLOps framework.

### Task 2: ML Pipeline & Experiment Tracking
- Preprocessed flight delay data and applied feature engineering.
- Trained a **Polynomial Ridge Regression model** with different alpha values.
- Tracked experiments and metrics using **MLflow**.
- Saved the final model and **airport encodings** for deployment.

### Task 3: API Deployment & Docker Containerization
- Built a **FastAPI** app (`api.py`) to expose a delay prediction model via RESTful endpoints.
- Developed a `/predict/delays` route to accept query parameters: `departure_airport`, `arrival_airport`, `departure_time`, and `arrival_time`.
- Loaded and used a Ridge Regression model and one-hot encoded airport vectors for prediction.
- Included error handling for invalid inputs and formatted prediction output.
- Packaged and published the model and API using **Docker**, deploying the container to the WGU GitLab registry.
